# Doodle: Compositional Vector Graphics

Copyright [Noel Welsh](http://noelwelsh.com).

Doodle is a Scala library for compositional vector graphics.

Distributed under the [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) license.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/creative-scala/doodle.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/creative-scala/doodle)


## Using Doodle

* The current release is **0.9.3** and is on the `master` branch.
* The current snapshot is **0.9.3-SNAPSHOT** and is on the `develop` branch.

To use doodle add the following to your `build.sbt`:

~~~ scala
scalaVersion := "2.12.8" // Doodle is currently published for Scala 2.12 only
libraryDependencies += "org.creativescala" %% "doodle" % "0.9.3"
~~~

Alternatively you can `git clone` or download Doodle and use it directly from the SBT console. See the instructions below.


## Documentation

[Documentation](https://www.creativescala.org/doodle/) is still a work-in-progress.

[Creative Scala][creativescala] provides another source of documentation for Doodle. Creative Scala is a free introductory Scala ebook.

Below we have a few tips to get you started.

### Getting Started from SBT

If you downloaded Doodle, rather than adding it to an existing Scala project, you can play around with it as follows.

1.  Start SBT:

    ~~~ bash
    bash$ sbt

    > # This is the SBT prompt. Press Ctrl+D to quit to the OS.
    ~~~

2.  Start the console:

    ~~~ coffee
    > rootJVM/console

    scala> # This is the Scala prompt. Press Ctrl+D to quit to SBT.
    ~~~

3.  Use Scala commands to draw a shape in a native window:

    ~~~ scala
    scala> (Image.circle(10).fillColor(Color.red)).draw()
    ~~~

    A window should appear containing a red circle.
    
4.  You can also save your masterpieces to a file.

    ~~~ scala
    scala> (Image.circle(10).fillColor.(Color.red)).write[Png]("masterpiece.png")
    ~~~
    
    Doodle currently supports writing to PNG, GIF, and JPG formats. Just alter the type parameter of `write` accordingly.

## Notes

These are notes for developers.

### Documentation

To generate the documentation run the `documentation` task in SBT *without* changing to any project. If you do the task just seems to disappear. I have no idea why. The output will be in `docs/target/docs`. Copy this to the website and upload.

If you run out of metaspace you can punch SBT in the face. Alternatively run just the documentation task (i.e. `sbt documentation`) and it seems to be happier.

### Publishing

To publish a snapshot:

* update the version number on `develop` in `publish.sbt`
* run `publishSigned`
* run `sonatypeRelease`
* update version number in this `README.md`
* tag `develop` with the snapshot version
* push tags to `origin`.

To publish a release:

* merge `develop` into `master`.
* update the version number on `master` in `publish.sbt`
* run `publishSigned`
* update the version number in `README.md` on both `develop` and `master`
* update the version number in `docs/src/main/mdoc/index.md` (can this be autogenerated somehow?)
* run `publishSigned`
* run `sonatypeRelease`
* tag `master` with the release version
* push tags to `origin`.
