![Current Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.creativescala/doodle_3)

Doodle is a Scala 3 only project. The current release is shown above and is on the `main` branch.

To use Doodle add the following to your `build.sbt`:

~~~ scala
// Doodle is currently published for Scala 3
libraryDependencies += "org.creativescala" %% "doodle" % "<version>"
~~~

replacing `<version>` with the latest version as shown above. (Be aware you only need the numeric part of the version. So use a string like `"0.20.0"` not `"v0.20.0"`).

## Notes

These are notes for developers.

### General Development

- Use the `build` task in sbt to compile and test everything, and run formatting.
- Use the `prePR` task for additional checks before submitting a PR.


### Documentation

Thanks to the *amazing* Typelevel SBT plugin, documentation should be built on every push to the master branch.

### Publishing

Push a tag of the form `v0.14.0`. Make sure `tlBaseVersion` matches the base version you're trying to release.
