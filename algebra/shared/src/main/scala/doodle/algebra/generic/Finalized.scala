/** A [[Finalized]] represents an effect that, when run, produces all the
  * information needed to layout an image (it "finalizes" all the information
  * needed for this process) and can eventually produce a value of type `A`
  * (once it is rendered). Algorithmically this means:
  *
  *   - for each shape work out its [[DrawingContext]] from which we can work
  *     out a [[doodle.core.BoundingBox]].
  *
  *   - apply transforms to bounding boxes at the point they are defined so each
  *     transformed subtree is laid out in its local coordinate system.
  *
  * The List of ContextTransform's are supplied in the order they should be
  * applied: the innermost transform is at the head of the list.
