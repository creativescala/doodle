/** An Interpolation represents a range of values between a starting and ending
  * value. The interpolation is also optionally transformed by an easing
  * function. The starting value is mapped to 0.0 and the ending value to 1.0.
  * When a number of steps is specified the interpolation is transformed into a
  * transducer, which may be run or composed with other transducers.
  *
  * Interpolations may be transformed by map and product (functor and
  * semigroupal) to construct more complex interpolations.
  *
  * The differences between an interpolation and a transducer are as follows:
  *
  *   - An interpolation specifies a start and end value. When a number of steps
  *     is given it becomes a transducer. When interpolations are combined in
  *     parallel, with product, they always take the same amount of time when
  *     converted to a transducer. Transducers combined in parallel may take
  *     differing amounts of time.
  *   - A transducer can represent arbitrary FSMs, while an interpolation moves
  *     from start to end value.
  *   - Transducers can be run. Interpolations must be transformed to
  *     transducers to run.
