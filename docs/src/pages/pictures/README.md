# Creating Pictures

This chapter covers everything you need to know to create pictures with Doodle. 
It starts with the two basic APIs that Doodle provides, @:api(doodle.algebra.Picture) and @:api(doodle.image.Image). `Image` is a little bit easier to use, while `Picture` is more powerful. You can't go wrong with either, but you'll need to choose one to start with.
We then move on to creating the basic elements of pictures: shapes, paths, and bitmaps. Once we have a picture, we will look at all many ways we can transform, style, and arrange them. Finally, we'll see how to draw a picture to the screen or save it to a file.
